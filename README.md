RIBCE books Converter
=====================

This software is used to convert the book files into a specific format that is used on the RIBCE.com site. 
At the moment, this converter can convert the files in old and new MS Word formats (*.doc and .docx).
In the near future we want to add support for the following formats: 

- Adobe PDF
- EPUB 
- FB2 

If you want to help in the development of the RIBCE project - join.
Now this part of the project is open source software. 

How you can help:

1) Add support for the formats listed above. To do this, you will need to implement a class that inherits from the abstract class Reader (see the file Core.cs) As an example, note how the class is implemented MSWord_Reader. 

2) Improve the processing algorithm MS Word files. 

3) You can also help us with the server part of the project. To do this, you will need programming skills in php and of muscle
